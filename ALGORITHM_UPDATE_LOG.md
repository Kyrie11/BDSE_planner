## Baseline context

- Paper: `Budgeted Decision-Sufficient Evidence for Interactive Autonomous Planning`
- Dataset/protocol: nuPlan DB train/validation; 2 s history, 8 s horizon; candidate bank default K=32; evidence budget B=16; proposal Top-M=64.
- Runtime checkpoint for controlled selector experiments: `outputs_v30/train/bdse_v30_pmvrbsr.best.pt`.
- v39 runtime outputs: 1000 aligned validation samples.
- Strict experimental principle: change the runtime selector first while freezing checkpoint, candidate bank, Top-M, B, pair queries, teacher and evaluation set.

## 2026-07-20 — v40 Lex-DACC

### Motivation

The v39 DACC strict runtime gate failed:

| Metric | v39 DACC | Gate / control condition |
|---|---:|---:|
| Teacher action match | 0.238 | absolute pass; paired pass |
| B=16 vs full-interface | 0.206 | absolute pass; paired LCB fail |
| Deployment target action preserved | 0.919 | required >= 0.950 |
| Winner-rival sign accuracy | 0.636914 | paired pass |
| Effective query count | 5383.152 | budget pass |

Paired `B=16 vs full` difference was +0.001, but the one-sided 95% LCB was -0.003354, below the strict -0.002 non-inferiority margin.

### Root-cause diagnosis

1. **Finite soft action penalty is incompatible with the gate.**
   - v39 adds `deployment_coreset_action_weight=4.0` to a continuous distortion loss.
   - On the 81 diagnostic action-flip samples, the deployment objective starts near 4, showing that the search accepts a deployment-action change whenever score/gap/margin distortion savings exceed the finite penalty.
   - Action preservation is therefore encouraged, not guaranteed.

2. **Top-8 exact screening can miss a preserving deletion.**
   - MARS is used to screen removal candidates, and only the top 8 receive exact deployment evaluation.
   - The surrogate and final deployment operator are not identical, so a preserving deletion can fall outside top 8.

3. **Generic post-fill can invalidate the DACC result.**
   - DACC diagnostics were computed before `_complete_safety_aware_selection()`.
   - The post-fill/quota logic can exchange atoms afterward.
   - Two observed samples reported target preservation in selector diagnostics but the actual final `bdse_action` differed.

4. **The failure is not caused by neural query budget or checkpoint capacity at this stage.**
   - v39 changed only 30/1000 final actions versus MARS control.
   - Query-count and all absolute safety/recall gates passed.
   - A counterfactual using the already logged DACC Top-M deployment target gives:
     - teacher match: 0.239; paired diff +0.001; LCB -0.004934, passing the -0.005 margin;
     - B-vs-full: 0.213; paired diff +0.008; LCB +0.001856, passing the -0.002 margin.
   - Therefore the first controlled intervention is to enforce target-action preservation, not to retrain the checkpoint.

### Algorithm modification

New runtime selector: **Lexicographic Deployment-Aligned Certificate Coreset (Lex-DACC)**.

Search priority:

1. preserve the exact full-Top-M deployment action whenever a feasible candidate exists;
2. among preserving subsets, minimize exact deployment score/gap/margin distortion;
3. accept an action-changing step only when no preserving step exists in the configured exact scan;
4. attempt exact one-swap repair and guided two-swap repair if the final greedy subset still changes the target action;
5. re-evaluate the actual post-fill set with the deployment callback, and revert post-fill when it breaks an action that DACC had preserved.

The deployment callback is unchanged and includes the actual downstream decision path: final rival graph, normalized antisymmetric pair margins, soft-min tournament, hard safety filtering, utility refinement, and all-flagged risk guard.

### Runtime/query properties

- Neural evidence queries: unchanged.
- Evidence budget: B=16, unchanged.
- Proposal pool: Top-M=64, unchanged.
- Pair-query budget: unchanged.
- Extra cost: deterministic CPU/Numpy deployment evaluations over already cached pair deltas.
- Exact-evaluation memoization remains active.

### Modified / added files

- `bdse/planner/selector.py`
  - lexicographic removal/exchange objective;
  - preserving-candidate scan expansion;
  - one/two-swap repair;
  - post-fill deployment audit and conditional revert;
  - additional diagnostics.
- `bdse/planner/nuplan_planner.py`
  - v40 selector aliases and config plumbing.
- `bdse/configs/v40_bdse_lexdacc_fast_cl.yaml`
- `bdse/configs/v40_bdse_lexdacc_fallback_fast_cl.yaml`
- `bdse/configs/v40_bdse_mars_control_fast_cl.yaml`
- `bdse/tools/check_v40_lexdacc_gate.py`
- `bdse/tests/test_v40_lexdacc.py`
- `run_v40_lexdacc.sh`

### New configuration

```yaml
selector_cap_mode: lexicographic_deployment_coreset
deployment_coreset_lexicographic_action_preservation: true
deployment_coreset_preservation_scan_candidates: 0  # scan all only if top-k has no preserving deletion
deployment_coreset_repair_one_swap: true
deployment_coreset_repair_two_swap_candidates: 256
```

### Verification completed in delivery environment

- `python -m py_compile`: passed.
- `bash -n run_v40_lexdacc.sh`: passed.
- full test suite: **120 passed, 5 warnings**.
- New regression tests verify:
  1. preserving deletion outside cheap exact top-1 is discovered;
  2. a destructive post-fill action flip is detected and reverted;
  3. v40 main/control/fallback configs are distinct and strict.

### Verification still required in nuPlan environment

- Strict 1000-scene open-loop runtime gate.
- CPU selector latency distribution, especially p95/p99.
- CL20 smoke test only after runtime gate passes.
- CL100 paired scenario-transition analysis.

### Do not repeat

- Do not increase the finite action penalty and call it a hard preservation guarantee.
- Do not use only Top-8 surrogate candidates without exact preserving-candidate expansion.
- Do not trust pre-post-fill DACC diagnostics as the final executed action.
- Do not change checkpoint and selector simultaneously before isolating the runtime effect.
- Do not launch closed-loop or finetuning when the strict runtime gate fails.
- Do not judge CL20 only by aggregate score; one binary scenario changes a mean by 0.05.

### Next decision rule

- If v40 passes strict open-loop gate and selector latency is acceptable: run CL20, then CL100.
- If target preservation remains below 0.95: inspect `forced_action_flip_steps`, repair success, and per-scene exact-evaluation counts; next candidate is beam-search deletion with action-preserving state dominance, not a larger soft penalty.
- If preservation passes but paired B-vs-full still fails: the Top-M target itself is not aligned enough with dense full-interface; next modification should redefine the deployment target or improve full-interface pair/local calibration.
- If open-loop passes but closed-loop safety regresses: keep Lex-DACC fixed and tune a separately identifiable safety fallback using paired collision/TTC transition counts.
