## Baseline context

- Paper: `Budgeted Decision-Sufficient Evidence for Interactive Autonomous Planning`
- Dataset/protocol: nuPlan DB train/validation; 2 s history, 8 s horizon; candidate bank default K=32; evidence budget B=16; proposal Top-M=64.
- Runtime checkpoint for controlled selector experiments: `outputs_v30/train/bdse_v30_pmvrbsr.best.pt`.
- v39 runtime outputs: 1000 aligned validation samples.
- Strict experimental principle: change the runtime selector first while freezing checkpoint, candidate bank, Top-M, B, pair queries, teacher and evaluation set.

## 2026-07-20 — v40 Lex-DACC

### Motivation

The v39 DACC strict runtime gate failed:

| Metric | v39 DACC | Gate / control condition |
|---|---:|---:|
| Teacher action match | 0.238 | absolute pass; paired pass |
| B=16 vs full-interface | 0.206 | absolute pass; paired LCB fail |
| Deployment target action preserved | 0.919 | required >= 0.950 |
| Winner-rival sign accuracy | 0.636914 | paired pass |
| Effective query count | 5383.152 | budget pass |

Paired `B=16 vs full` difference was +0.001, but the one-sided 95% LCB was -0.003354, below the strict -0.002 non-inferiority margin.

### Root-cause diagnosis

1. **Finite soft action penalty is incompatible with the gate.**
   - v39 adds `deployment_coreset_action_weight=4.0` to a continuous distortion loss.
   - On the 81 diagnostic action-flip samples, the deployment objective starts near 4, showing that the search accepts a deployment-action change whenever score/gap/margin distortion savings exceed the finite penalty.
   - Action preservation is therefore encouraged, not guaranteed.

2. **Top-8 exact screening can miss a preserving deletion.**
   - MARS is used to screen removal candidates, and only the top 8 receive exact deployment evaluation.
   - The surrogate and final deployment operator are not identical, so a preserving deletion can fall outside top 8.

3. **Generic post-fill can invalidate the DACC result.**
   - DACC diagnostics were computed before `_complete_safety_aware_selection()`.
   - The post-fill/quota logic can exchange atoms afterward.
   - Two observed samples reported target preservation in selector diagnostics but the actual final `bdse_action` differed.

4. **The failure is not caused by neural query budget or checkpoint capacity at this stage.**
   - v39 changed only 30/1000 final actions versus MARS control.
   - Query-count and all absolute safety/recall gates passed.
   - A counterfactual using the already logged DACC Top-M deployment target gives:
     - teacher match: 0.239; paired diff +0.001; LCB -0.004934, passing the -0.005 margin;
     - B-vs-full: 0.213; paired diff +0.008; LCB +0.001856, passing the -0.002 margin.
   - Therefore the first controlled intervention is to enforce target-action preservation, not to retrain the checkpoint.

### Algorithm modification

New runtime selector: **Lexicographic Deployment-Aligned Certificate Coreset (Lex-DACC)**.

Search priority:

1. preserve the exact full-Top-M deployment action whenever a feasible candidate exists;
2. among preserving subsets, minimize exact deployment score/gap/margin distortion;
3. accept an action-changing step only when no preserving step exists in the configured exact scan;
4. attempt exact one-swap repair and guided two-swap repair if the final greedy subset still changes the target action;
5. re-evaluate the actual post-fill set with the deployment callback, and revert post-fill when it breaks an action that DACC had preserved.

The deployment callback is unchanged and includes the actual downstream decision path: final rival graph, normalized antisymmetric pair margins, soft-min tournament, hard safety filtering, utility refinement, and all-flagged risk guard.

### Runtime/query properties

- Neural evidence queries: unchanged.
- Evidence budget: B=16, unchanged.
- Proposal pool: Top-M=64, unchanged.
- Pair-query budget: unchanged.
- Extra cost: deterministic CPU/Numpy deployment evaluations over already cached pair deltas.
- Exact-evaluation memoization remains active.

### Modified / added files

- `bdse/planner/selector.py`
  - lexicographic removal/exchange objective;
  - preserving-candidate scan expansion;
  - one/two-swap repair;
  - post-fill deployment audit and conditional revert;
  - additional diagnostics.
- `bdse/planner/nuplan_planner.py`
  - v40 selector aliases and config plumbing.
- `bdse/configs/v40_bdse_lexdacc_fast_cl.yaml`
- `bdse/configs/v40_bdse_lexdacc_fallback_fast_cl.yaml`
- `bdse/configs/v40_bdse_mars_control_fast_cl.yaml`
- `bdse/tools/check_v40_lexdacc_gate.py`
- `bdse/tests/test_v40_lexdacc.py`
- `run_v40_lexdacc.sh`

### New configuration

```yaml
selector_cap_mode: lexicographic_deployment_coreset
deployment_coreset_lexicographic_action_preservation: true
deployment_coreset_preservation_scan_candidates: 0  # scan all only if top-k has no preserving deletion
deployment_coreset_repair_one_swap: true
deployment_coreset_repair_two_swap_candidates: 256
```

### Verification completed in delivery environment

- `python -m py_compile`: passed.
- `bash -n run_v40_lexdacc.sh`: passed.
- full test suite: **120 passed, 5 warnings**.
- New regression tests verify:
  1. preserving deletion outside cheap exact top-1 is discovered;
  2. a destructive post-fill action flip is detected and reverted;
  3. v40 main/control/fallback configs are distinct and strict.

### Verification still required in nuPlan environment

- Strict 1000-scene open-loop runtime gate.
- CPU selector latency distribution, especially p95/p99.
- CL20 smoke test only after runtime gate passes.
- CL100 paired scenario-transition analysis.

### Do not repeat

- Do not increase the finite action penalty and call it a hard preservation guarantee.
- Do not use only Top-8 surrogate candidates without exact preserving-candidate expansion.
- Do not trust pre-post-fill DACC diagnostics as the final executed action.
- Do not change checkpoint and selector simultaneously before isolating the runtime effect.
- Do not launch closed-loop or finetuning when the strict runtime gate fails.
- Do not judge CL20 only by aggregate score; one binary scenario changes a mean by 0.05.

### Next decision rule

- If v40 passes strict open-loop gate and selector latency is acceptable: run CL20, then CL100.
- If target preservation remains below 0.95: inspect `forced_action_flip_steps`, repair success, and per-scene exact-evaluation counts; next candidate is beam-search deletion with action-preserving state dominance, not a larger soft penalty.
- If preservation passes but paired B-vs-full still fails: the Top-M target itself is not aligned enough with dense full-interface; next modification should redefine the deployment target or improve full-interface pair/local calibration.
- If open-loop passes but closed-loop safety regresses: keep Lex-DACC fixed and tune a separately identifiable safety fallback using paired collision/TTC transition counts.

## 2026-07-20 — v41 PR-DACC (Path-Relaxed Deployment-Aligned Certificate Coreset)

### Motivation

The v40 strict 1000-scenario runtime gate still failed, but only one hard condition failed:

| Metric | v40 PR predecessor | Gate / control condition | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Teacher action match | 0.239 | paired LCB >= -0.005 | pass, LCB -0.003937 |
| B=16 vs full-interface | 0.209 | paired LCB >= -0.002 | pass, LCB -0.001200 |
| Winner-rival sign accuracy | 0.638470 | paired LCB >= -0.005 | pass, LCB -0.003047 |
| Deployment target action preserved | **0.946** | **>= 0.950** | **fail by 4/1000 scenarios** |
| Effective query count | 5383.152 | unchanged budget | pass |

The v40 main output contained 54 target-action preservation failures.

### Failure slices and diagnosis

1. **The finite-penalty problem was fixed, but the remaining search is path dependent.**
   - Failed samples averaged **6.35 forced action-flip deletion steps** versus 0.013 on preserved samples.
   - Failed samples averaged 306.61 expanded exact deletion scans and 750.41 deployment evaluations.
   - Thus v40 already exhausts every feasible one-step deletion whenever the cheap top-k has no preserving candidate; the problem is no longer a missed top-k item at one state.

2. **The single greedy subset path reaches a dead end.**
   - Lex-DACC keeps only one subset after every deletion.
   - It can choose an action-preserving deletion that is locally best but later reaches a cardinality where every possible next deletion changes the target action.
   - A different earlier branch, or a branch that temporarily changes the action and later restores it, is never retained.

3. **The local repair radius is insufficient.**
   - Every failed sample exhaustively evaluated 224 one-swap candidates.
   - Every failed sample evaluated the configured top 256 two-swap candidates.
   - Only 4/1000 total samples were repaired by v40, and none of the final 54 failures were repairable by the retained one/two-swap search.
   - Increasing the same local-swap candidate count alone is therefore not the primary algorithmic fix.

4. **A residual graph mismatch remained in the cheap branch screen.**
   - v40 exact subset evaluation uses `rival_pair_atom_delta/rival_pair_indices`, which drive the final tournament.
   - The cheap deletion/swap screen still receives `pair_atom_delta/pair_indices`, the selector graph.
   - This does not change exact decisions, but it can prevent a useful branch from entering a bounded multi-path search.

5. **The failure is localized to coreset search rather than checkpoint/query capacity.**
   - All paired non-inferiority tests passed.
   - Query counts are exactly unchanged from the MARS control.
   - 49/54 failed v40 scenes selected the same final action as the MARS control.
   - Therefore v41 keeps the v30 checkpoint, B=16, Top-M, candidate bank, teacher, pair-query outputs and validation scenarios fixed.

### Hypothesis

Target-action preservation under a cardinality/budget constraint is not a monotone property along a greedy deletion path. A bounded subset-lattice beam that retains:

- exact target-preserving states; and
- a small, action-diverse set of temporarily mismatching states

can recover feasible final B=16 subsets that a single-path lexicographic greedy plus local exchange cannot reach.

### Algorithm changes

New runtime selector alias: **PR-DACC / Path-Relaxed DACC**.

1. **Deployment-graph-aligned screening**
   - When enabled, the coreset search receives the already queried final rival pair graph.
   - Exact evaluator and cheap screen now use the same pair index/delta family.
   - Rival graph weights are set to one because the deployed tournament is unweighted over its rival sets.

2. **Failure-triggered action-diverse beam search**
   - Triggered only when lexicographic deletion and one/two-swap repair still change the Top-M deployment action.
   - Starts from the complete active Top-M decision atom set.
   - Searches exactly the same final cardinality as the greedy B=16 set.
   - Retains both preserving states and a configured fraction of mismatching states.
   - Mismatching states are diversified by their exact deployed action so the beam does not collapse to one wrong winner.
   - Branch candidates combine four cheap rankings:
     - deployment distortion screen;
     - low target-action pair impact;
     - target-harming oriented contribution;
     - low proposal prior.
   - Every retained child is evaluated by the unchanged exact downstream deployment callback.
   - A beam result replaces v40 only when it exactly restores the target action and satisfies the budget.

3. **Bounded computation and unchanged model queries**
   - Beam is disabled on the 94.6% v40-preserved cases.
   - Default bound: width 12, branch 14, at most 2400 new exact subset evaluations per triggered scene.
   - No extra neural inference or evidence query is performed.

### Configuration

```yaml
selector_cap_mode: path_relaxed_deployment_coreset
deployment_coreset_use_deployment_pair_graph: true
deployment_coreset_beam_width: 12
deployment_coreset_beam_branch: 14
deployment_coreset_beam_max_evaluations: 2400
deployment_coreset_beam_mismatch_fraction: 0.42
```

The v40 lexicographic scan, one-swap repair, guided two-swap repair and post-fill audit remain enabled.

### Modified / added files

  - bounded fixed-cardinality deletion-lattice beam;
  - action-diverse beam pruning;
  - target-oriented branch features;
  - beam diagnostics and config plumbing;
  - new PR-DACC aliases.

- `run_v41_prdacc.sh`

### Controlled variables

Unchanged:

- checkpoint: `outputs_v30/train/bdse_v30_pmvrbsr.best.pt`;
- validation scenarios/order;
- candidate trajectories and K;
- proposal Top-M and evidence bank;
- budget B=16;
- neural pair/local predictions;
- teacher labels;
- final tournament, safety guard, utility refinement and all-flagged guard;
- MARS control configuration.

### Validation completed in the delivery environment

- all Python files compile;
- `bash -n run_v41_prdacc.sh` passes;
- full test suite: **122 passed, 5 warnings**;
- new synthetic regression verifies a case where:
  - the target action disappears at an intermediate cardinality;
  - the v40 single path ends with the wrong action;
  - PR-DACC keeps a temporary mismatch branch and restores the target at the final budget;
- v41 configs load and require the rival graph plus bounded beam.

### Runtime validation still required

No nuPlan cache or v30 checkpoint is available in the delivery environment, so no claim is made that v41 already passes the 1000-scene gate.

Inspect after running:

```text
selector_deployment_coreset_target_action_preserved
selector_deployment_coreset_beam_attempted
selector_deployment_coreset_beam_success
selector_deployment_coreset_beam_evaluations
selector_deployment_coreset_beam_depth
selector_deployment_coreset_beam_peak_width
selector_deployment_coreset_search_uses_rival_graph
```

### Do not repeat

- Do not lower the 0.95 gate or relabel the v40 result as a pass.
- Do not increase `deployment_coreset_action_weight`; v40 already uses a true lexicographic comparison.
- Do not only increase the two-swap top-k and treat it as a path-dependence solution.
- Do not enable a full beam on every scenario; it wastes runtime on already-preserved samples.
- Do not change checkpoint or finetune while testing v41 runtime search.
- Do not compare v41 against a newly changed control; retain the frozen MARS control.
- Do not run closed loop until the strict open-loop gate passes.

### Next decision rule

- If preservation reaches >=0.95 and all paired gates pass: measure selector evaluation count/latency, then run CL20 and CL100.
- If beam success recovers at least 4 scenes but another paired metric fails: inspect the exact recovered/lost action transitions before changing beam width.
- If beam is attempted on the 54-like failures but success remains near zero: the target action may be infeasible at B=16 for those scenes; next step is a target-feasibility diagnostic or deployment-target redefinition, not a larger blind beam.
- If beam reaches the 2400-evaluation cap before full depth: increase the cap only after confirming branch diversity is useful; do not increase width, branch and cap simultaneously.
